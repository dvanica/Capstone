    <p>
      Territorial Cup: Word Duel in the Desert is a game that pits ASU against UA in a battle for territory in Arizona, 
	  although this not the game of footballâ€¦it is the game of words! Each player signs up to play for their favorite school
	  and then enters the game. Pick letters from ANYWHERE on the board to make a word, but be fast - you only have 60 seconds
	  to find as many words as possible. Each letter is worth a point and there are bonuses for players who find more words within
	  the time limit. Each board is randomized, so every game is unique! At the end of the time limit, your score is factored into
	  your school's average. The school with the highest average score wins! The competition doesn't end there, though. Individual players
	  with high scores are also recognized as champions for their school. This project was created in HTML5 and CSS3 using an MVC architecture.

         <br />Updates on previous items:<ul>
            <li>Jarrett and Shane have Dictionary API set up in controller</li>
            <li>Danielle has Ajax call working with model, but running into issues. See information items.</li>
            <li>No update from Steve, but update from Bob about hidden fields instead of Ajax calls.</li>
          </ul>
          Information Items:<ul>
			<li>Any call to the model will re-return the view, so passing the word back to the board will not work. After discussion,
				it makes more sense (and aligns with MVC) to pass the data back to a controller so it can process the data and then
				direct the model and view to change, as needed. Jarrett and Shane already have a dictionary API set up in the controller.</li>

          <br />Updates on previous items:<ul>
            <li>Danielle fixed Ajax call to work with controller. Currently only passing static strings.</li>
            <li>Matt and Shane added some style to the site - logo, formatting, school brands, etc.</li>
            <li>Ryan added 60 second game timer and pop-up to notify "game over"</li>
			<li>Danielle had update meeting and discussion with the professor on Tuesday to discuss team progress and future direction.</li>
			<li>Jaylee wrote up a status report for the team. See action items for future use.</li>
          </ul>
          Information Items:<ul>
            <li>Dictionary API is not quite working, theory is that because Ajax is passing as Json and API uses XML, there may be some errors there. When Danielle
				tested, all words > 2 characters (e.g. 'dog', 'hhh', 'dadasdf') returned a 'true' from the API. All words <2 characters (e.g. 'h') returned null. However,
				when controller method was changed to just return the original word plus a concatenated 'yay' or ':)', method and Ajax calls worked for all strings tested.</li>
            <li>Team presentation has officially been assigned. Team 7 presents 1 May 2015.</li>
            <li>Team report has officially been assigned.</li>
			<li>Individual report is approaching. </li>
			<li>Exit exam scheduled for three weeks from today. Attendance is mandatory.</li>
			<li>TA will be attending future meetings</li>
			<li>Team discussed scoring system - points for each letter used as well as a tier system for bonus points. e.g. 20 extra points for finding 10-15 words, 
				25 extra points for finding 15-20 words, etc. </li>
          </ul>
          Action Items before next meeting (4/3/2015):<ul>
            <li>Danielle to add a dynamic label so users can see their current word.</li>
			<li>Danielle to add a method to convert tile ids into a word to pass to the controller.</li>
            <li>Team to review and revise Jaylee's status report. Team will get TA and Instructor final approval. 
				Upon approval, team will send status report and recommendations to Sogeti Team.</li>
