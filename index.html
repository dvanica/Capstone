<p>
Territorial Cup: Word Duel in the Desert is a game that pits ASU against UA in a battle for territory in Arizona, although this not the game of footballâ€¦it is the game of words! Players will take turns making words from an Arizona shaped board of letters. Pick letters from ANYWHERE on the board to make a word and turn them into your color. Each letter is worth a point and whoever has the highest score at the end wins. The game ends when every letter has a color and the player that colors Arizona the most wins.
This project will be created in HTML5 and will be responsive (adjust to different screen sizes) using CSS3. The game will be networked and communicate with a backend that has a SQL database.
