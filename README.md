Project Name: Territorial Cup: Word Duel in the Desert 

Sponsor: Steve Cimino, Robert Erikson, and Arun Navaneethan with Sogeti USA

Project Description: Territorial Cup: Word Duel in the Desert is a game that pits ASU against UA in a battle for territory in Arizona, although this not the game of footballâ€¦it is the game of words! Players will take turns making words from an Arizona shaped board of letters. Pick letters from ANYWHERE on the board to make a word and turn them into your color. Each letter is worth a point and whoever has the highest score at the end wins. The game ends when every letter has a color and the player that colors Arizona the most wins.
